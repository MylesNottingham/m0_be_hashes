# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

The idea of symbols is still settling in my head. I particularly struggled when some keys were saved as symbols and others were saved as strings.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Great! I love the Apple Notes program. I start a new notepad for every lesson.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try and solve myself first and when I realize my struggle is no longer productive I will start going up the ladder of resources.
